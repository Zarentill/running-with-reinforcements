Play as a commander unit who cannot purchase additional gear.

Always spawns with an EOD Suit (10-shot Vest?), 1 flash grenade, and a highly accurate, single shot, instant kill pistol with a fairly long reload time. Player has drastically increased movement speed. Look in Factions > default_base.character file for movement speed?

Call in air drops to control the battlefield.
	-Need a way to strictly control RP gain, as I don't think I can put cooldowns on Air Drops
	-Need a way to strictly control XP gain, so as to keep the tiers of Air Drops fair
	-Need a large variety of Air Drops
	-Possible to Air Drop vehicles + soldiers who will then man said vehicles?

Custom map, very linear.
	-Symmetrical, linear map. 5 territories to capture. 2 HQ's, 3 contested.
	-Map is designed so that the AI commander can only ever choose the next adjacent territory to attack.
	-Each of the territories is fairly large in and of itself, allowing for a handful of different strategies to conquer.
	-This is done so that you aren't fighting the AI Commander for where to send your troops.
	-Middle territory gives a bonus to RP / XP perhaps?
	-Radio towers in both HQ's prevent direct assaults. (Quite possible there is no way to take these out?)
	-Each territory should have a small garrison defending it.
	-There should be no attacking troops by default. Only troops you spawn should be offensive. May need a small handful of attacking troops, but not many.
	
All bullets have 100% lethality. Accuracy, rate of fire, and distance of lethality are HUGE and must be balanced.
Armor is also HUGE, vests effectively become everyones "HP". Need to find ways to increase amount of lethal shots a Vest can take.

Certain (or all) enemies always drop a fixed RP value item? Perhaps only the cannon fodder attacking enemies (not Air Dropped ones) drop these items?

Combat vehicles will most likely not be introduced, as they can be difficult to control, or even use effectively with AI. Spawn trucks, radar trucks, jamming trucks, and transport trucks might be used by the player Commanders.

3-4 spaces are opened up in the Radio menu with no vehicle spawns.

Infantry Air Drops will all have a fixed number, based upon the type of squad being called in.

Air Drops:

	-Infantry Squad (10): 10 troops with: Assault Rifle, Cover, 1 Impact Grenade, 2-shot Vest. (Vest Type-I)

	-Heavy Squad (15): 4 troops with: HMG, SMG, 3 Frag Grenades, 5-shot Vest. (Vest Type-III)

	-Medic Squad (15): 4 troops with: Shotgun, 2 Med-Pack, 1 Frag Grenade, 3-shot Vest. (Vest Type-II)

	-Sniper Squad (20): 2 troops with: Sniper Rifle, Med-Pack, 2 Flash Grenades, 2-shot Vest. (Vest Type-I)

RP / XP

	-RP is gained on a timed basis? 1 RP per second?
	-The middle territory gives +1 RP per 10 seconds?
	-Enemy units all drop a single "Gem" item that sells for 1 RP
	-Higher tier units drop more RP? Or only fodder units drop RP.
	-RP is spent exclusively on radio Air Drops
	
	-RP could also be spend at the armory to unlock higher tier Air Drops via special, custom items. (Requires some in depth modding)
	-Look at the Radar Tower xml for ideas. Make crates that respawn & award RP / XP when knifed?
	-Scatter crates around certain highly contested areas of the map, making them risking to farm.
	-Should also be a small number of crates back at HQ to guarantee you can always get RP, unless the passive RP gain system is used?
	
	-aa-emplacement.vehicle for ideas on limiting radio calls?
	
	-Killing enemies gives XP.
	-XP is gained slowly over time, maybe 10 per second?
	-Higher tiers of XP unlock better radio call ins?
