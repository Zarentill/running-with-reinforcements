This file will contain a list of the various features & design goals we intend to have in the mod.


#Design Doc - Primary changes to gameplay mechanics:

Well the original concept was pretty simple to implement. Just custom npc groups. I was thinking a 5 man shotgun assault squad with EOD suits. A dedicated 5 man medic team with LMG's, a basic 10 man infantry squad with assault rifles, and a dedicated 2 man sniper team. All bullets are 100% lethal. Snipers are 300% lethal for armor piercing effect. Every unit is wearing some kind of armor, and have various different grenades & things equipped (determined by the type of squad they are). And for the initial prototype without a custom map, we will need to set it up so that players gain a constant trickle of RP to spend on calls. Also XP should probably be disabled for the most part. I have ideas on how to utilize it in the future as sort of "tech tiers" but for this version, all calls would just be enabled by default. Also need to tweak the player a little bit, to make him a bit weaker. Single shot pistol, 100% lethal, but still takes 2-3 shots depending on enemy armor. Have no armor by default. Oh, and we'd need to remove pretty much everything from the armory that is purchasable. Eventually we could play with that, but at the start, I want just a shitty, locked loadout for the commanders.

Outside of that, we could try tweaking AI files a little & implement a rear guard sort of squad, but I don't think that's strictly needed until a little later.

And when we do start tweaking AI, we need to save any version that we think is working fairly "okay" before changing it again.
Just so we can revert back if we change something silly & it drastically alters the AI for the worse lol.
