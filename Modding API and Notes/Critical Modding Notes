When editing a faction's .xml (and also _boss.xml if it is also listed in the scripts\my_stage_configurator.as) the default group must 
retain the start of:
  <soldier name="default"
This requirement is either due to hard coding, unverified actionscript reference, or possibly a dependence with sqaud_config?


When adding a modded vehicle the .vehicle entry mut be added to both lists:
  all_vehicles
  invasion_all_vehicles
