When positioning drivers, passangers, or gunners (controled by turret value, turret offset="0 -2.0 0.0") the value of 
position="0.0 0.0 0.0" relatesto the forward facing direction of the vehicle int he following way:
  position="#.# 0.0 0.0" ; Where # is positive is to the horizontal left of the vehicle center line and negative is horizontal right
  position="0.0 #.# 0.0" ; Where # is positive is to the verticle up from the vehicle center line and negative is vertical down
  position="0.0 0.0 #.#" ; Where # is positive is to the horizontal forward of the vehicle center line and negative is horizontal rear

*****

When adding gravity to physics section of .vehicle, for whatever reason, negative and a value is down towards the ground. Also, it is very finiky.

*****

When changing the file name of a .vehicle a new campaing (maybe jsut map) must be started for that to be loaded into the current map.
